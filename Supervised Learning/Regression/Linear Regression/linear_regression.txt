### **What is Linear Regression?**

- Linear regression is a basic yet powerful statistical method used to understand the relationship between two variables.
  It predicts a target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input variables (independent variables).
  The idea is to find the best-fitting straight line (linear relationship) that minimizes the differences (errors)
  between actual data points and the predicted values on this line.

### **How Does Linear Regression Work?**

- In simple terms, linear regression works by fitting a line to the data that represents the relationship between the
  input variable(s) and the output variable. The equation of the line is:

\[
y = mx + c
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted value (dependent variable).
- \( x \) is the input feature (independent variable).
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (indicates how much \( y \) changes with \( x \)).
- \( c \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \)).

In multiple linear regression, where there are multiple input features, the equation becomes:

\[
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
\]

Where:
- \( w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \) are the coefficients (weights) for each feature.
- \( b \) is the intercept.

### **Example: Predicting House Prices**

- Suppose you want to predict the price of a house based on its size. You have data on house prices
  (dependent variable \( y \)) and their corresponding sizes (independent variable \( x \)).

| House Size (sq. ft) | House Price ($) |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1,000               | 200,000         |
| 1,500               | 300,000         |
| 2,000               | 400,000         |
| 2,500               | 500,000         |

- You can plot this data on a graph with house size on the x-axis and house price on the y-axis.
- Linear regression will find the best-fitting line that represents the relationship between house size and price.

The equation might look like:

\[
\text{House Price} = 200 \times \text{Size (sq. ft)} + 0
\]

Here, the slope \( m = 200 \) indicates that for every additional square foot, the house price increases by $200.

### **When to Use Linear Regression**

Linear regression is useful when:

1. **There is a linear relationship** between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable.
2. **You want to predict** a continuous value (like house prices, temperature, etc.).
3. **You need interpretability**: The coefficients tell you the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.

### **Limitations**

- **Assumes linearity**: It doesnâ€™t work well if the relationship between variables is not linear.
- **Sensitive to outliers**: Extreme values can skew the results.
- **Correlation does not imply causation**: A strong linear relationship doesn't mean one variable causes the other.

### **Summary**

- Linear regression is a fundamental tool for predicting outcomes based on linear relationships. It's simple,
  interpretable, and widely used in various fields like economics, finance, and the social sciences.
