linear regression
------------------

- home prices, weather, stock price   -> related to numbers, not one of define categories(i.e. democratic, repulican, independent)

-> predicted value is continuous


logistic regression
--------------------

- email is spam or not                    -> yes or no
- will customer buy life insurance        -> yes or no
- which party a person is going to vote for? -> 1.democratic  2.repulican  3.independent

-> predicted value is categorical

-> above type of problem are called classification problem and logistic regression is a technique that is used to solve these classification
   problem


classification types: -> binary classification and multiclass classification


1) binary classification -> que: will customer buy life insurance    ans: yes or no

		- only two in response(yes or no)

2) multiclass classification -> que: which party a person is going to vote for?  ans: 1.democratic  2.repulican  3.independent

		- more than two categories(democratic, repulican, independent)

3) decision tree classification

        - handling of categorical data, or capturing non-linear relationships is essential.
        - can be used for both regression and classification
        - can capture complex and non-linear relationships between features and the target variable
        - Avoid Decision Trees: When working with very large datasets, complex features, or needing better performance
          (use Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).
